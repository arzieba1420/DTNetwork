**DTNetwork project**
===================

**About**
----------
This is my first fully commercial Spring Boot project!

It is kind of WebApp which will be used as a repository (or database) of information about some technical devices 
maintained by me in my current job.
On a daily basis it works in closed local network in my company, but I prepaired its demo version. The version uses an embeded simulation of database and includes sample datas, entries etc to demonstrate how it looks in production mode.

~~**The app is not ready yet to use, it will take about one month to release first stable version [written: 4 April 2019 ]**


[UPDATE 11-05-2019]  
**1st stable version of my project is available and ready to be tested on branch master. Any further version will appear in the future**  
[UPDATE 17-05-2019]  
**2nd stable version of my project is available and ready to be tested on branch master. Any further version will appear in the future**  
[UPDATE 25-05-2019]  
**I have just added ZIP packages with jar executable files in Releases with ENG and PL language versions (version 1.3)**
[UPDATE 22-07-2019]  
**ENG version of the project will no longer be developed. I focus on PL version only from now**

**DTNetwork project**
===================

**About**
----------
This is my first Spring project created only by myself!

It is kind of WebApp which will be used as a repository (or database) of information about some technical devices 
maintained by me in my current job.

**The app is not ready yet to use, it will take about one month to release first stable version [written: 4 April 2019 ]**

**Used technologies:**
-----------------------
* Java 8
* Spring v.5 and SpringBoot v.2 (includes Spring Security, Spring Validator, JPA, Hibernate, Lombok, etc.)
* Thymeleaf
* HTML5+CSS+JS
* IntelliJ 2018 as an IDE
* Cooperates with DB based on MariaDB engine
 

**To run:**
-------------
* Java JRE installed
* ~~application.properties file with definied ConnectionString to Your DB in resources directory~~ (I decided to provide test DB and include connection string in source code)
* Firefox Quantum browser (I work with Firefox Quantum 65.0.2, don't guarantee that all of CSS styles will perform properly with other browsers)
* In Spring Security login form put DTN and DTN1 as login and pass (test account)
